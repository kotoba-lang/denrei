  "MembershipGovernor — the independent censor that earns post-LLM the right
  to *propose* a draft. The LLM has no notion of channel membership, mention
  consent state, tenant boundaries, or the no-actuation charter, so this MUST
  be a separate system (rules over the store's ground facts) able to *reject*
  a proposal and fall back to HOLD — the denrei analog of koyomi's/tayori's
  ComplianceGovernor.

  The actor is **propose → draft only**. It never posts into the space
  itself; posting is ALWAYS routed to a human (the denrei analog of tayori's
  always-human `:reply/send` / koyomi's always-human `:event/share`). Below,
  HARD invariants force HOLD (a human cannot approve past a proposal that
  claims to have already posted, a post into a channel the actor's member
  identity doesn't belong to, a mention of a consent-blocked member, or a
  message whose tenant doesn't match the activity driving it); a clean post
  still routes to a human (high-stakes).

  HARD invariants:
    :message/draft
      1. Subject-exists   — the driving activity (:activity on the request)
                            must actually be registered (mirrors koyomi's
                            missing-activity, tayori's missing-thread).
      2. No-actuation     — proposal :effect must be :draft, never :post (a
                            control-plane record, never an outbound message).
      3. Target-integrity — the content's :space/:channel must equal the
                            request's (a same-tenant channel switch by the
                            LLM is a hijack of the human's review context).
      4. Channel-exists   — the target space AND channel must be registered
                            ground facts (never draft into a phantom channel).
      5. Membership       — the message's :kaisha/author (the actor's own
                            member identity) must be a member of the target
                            channel. Posting into #ops without membership is
                            structurally impossible, not merely reviewed.
      6. Model-validity   — `kaisha.validate/message-problems` over the
                            registered space: unknown author, missing
                            timestamp, orphan reply, nested thread. The
                            surface model's own invariants are the governor's
                            floor, not a separate convention.
      7. Tenant-isolation — the proposed content's :tenant must equal the
                            tenant derived from the driving activity's :repo.
    :message/post
      1. Subject-exists   — same activity-exists check as :message/draft.
      2. Draft-exists     — there must already be a committed draft for the
                            message (`store/draft-of`) — otherwise this would
                            be a phantom post of nil content that still
                            writes a false :posted/:committed ledger fact.
      3. Consent-required — EVERY @mention in the draft body (via
                            `kaisha.model/mentions`, the SAME parser the
                            ChannelTarget uses at delivery time) must not be
                            :consent :blocked. A :first-contact? mention is
                            NOT a hard violation (mirrors tayori's contact
                            model exactly) but IS high-stakes below.
      4. Channel-exists / Membership / Tenant-isolation — same checks, over
         the already-committed draft's content (defense-in-depth: the same
         sanity checks apply at both the draft and the post gate).
    (any other op) — an unrecognized :op is itself a hard violation
                     (fail-closed: a not-yet-wired op must never silently
                     pass as clean).
  SOFT:
    Confidence floor → escalate.
    Duplicate-body — an existing message in the target channel with an
      identical body → escalate, never hard (a legitimate re-announcement is
      possible; a human should still take a look before the space gets
      repetitive-bot noise).
    `:message/post` is ALWAYS high-stakes → human, at every phase. Any
      :first-contact? mention also forces high-stakes (even at
      :message/draft) — mirrors tayori's contact model, applied to mentioned
      members instead of message recipients."
