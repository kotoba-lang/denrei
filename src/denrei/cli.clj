(ns denrei.cli
  "Minimal JVM entrypoint for `denrei.query` against an EDN-seeded MemStore —
  no StateGraph/checkpointer/advisor spun up, just a status read. For a
  process boundary consumer that needs one message's draft status without an
  in-process require across runtimes.

  Usage: `clojure -M -m denrei.cli <ledger.edn> <message-id>` — prints the
  draft status (\"proposed\"/\"posted\"/\"none\") and exits 0 on \"posted\", 1
  otherwise (so callers can also just check the exit code).

  <ledger.edn> holds the same shape as `denrei.store/demo-data`'s :drafts map
  (at minimum {:drafts {\"<message-id>\" {:status :posted}}})."
  (:require [clojure.edn :as edn]
            [denrei.query :as query]
            [denrei.store :as store]))

  (let [data (edn/read-string (slurp ledger-path))

        status (query/draft-status st message-id)]
