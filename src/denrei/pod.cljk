  "Live ChannelTarget backed by a kaisha pod — a kotoba-server datom graph
  (ADR-2607072400: the realtime pod lives on the murakumo fleet's resident
  kotoba-server; reachability is tailnet today, murakumo.cloud overlay later;
  kotobase.net keeps the public HTTP face).

  The target speaks ONLY the langchain.db `:db-api` map ({:q :transact! :db
  :pull :entid}) — `langchain.db/api` (in-process EAVT) and
  `langchain.kotoba-db/kotoba-api` (kotoba-server XRPC) both implement it, so
  the SAME ChannelTarget runs against an in-memory store (tests, offline) or
  a live fleet pod (production) by construction — the exact swap
  denrei.store's MemStore ≡ DatomicStore contract already proves for the SSoT.

  Delivery model: `post!` transacts the delivery record (the governed wire
  form denrei.channelport/delivery-record builds — mention set included) into
  the pod graph as durable datoms, indexed by channel
  (`:kaisha-msg/channel` = \"<space>/<channel>\"). Fan-out consumers (a
  kaisha UI, another actor, a follower process) read that index —
  `channel-messages` is the reference query, `messages-since`/`follow!` the
  incremental tail. The pod graph IS the fan-out substrate; no side-channel
  event bus to keep consistent with what was governed, and deliberately NO
  KSE/LiveBus dependency (kotoba-server-runtime-only, ephemeral, absent from
  the kotobase/kotoba-peer engines — ADR-2607072400 addendum).

  post! is only ever called by denrei.operation's commit step, after human
  approval — same charter as every other ChannelTarget."
